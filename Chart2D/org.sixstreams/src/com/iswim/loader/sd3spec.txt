	  Introduction

	  United States Swimming has matured as an organization and
	  expanded services to individuals and clubs.  To support this
	  expansion, USS has developed a computer plan. One component is a
	  standard interchange format for technical data.  Swimming data
	  must be transmitted among the clubs, Local Swimming Committees
	  (LSCs), and the USS headquarters office.  Exchanging meet results
	  is one example, where data from a host club is distributed to
	  swimmers and clubs using diskettes or modems.  Some LSCs are
	  compiling swimmer statistics and would retype the data from
	  printed sheets if electronic transmission were not available. 
	  A standard format promotes easy exchange of data and the
	  development of new computer programs and services.  The goal is
	  to preserve the valuable efforts of our volunteers.

	  To develop this standard, United States Swimming established an
	  ad-hoc committee to review existing needs and prepare a draft
	  design.    A representative from US Masters Swimming and a coach
	  familiar with high school and college swimming requirements
	  contributed significantly to the final design.  The design is
	  intended to allow all aquatic sports organizations to use the
	  same standard.  New records can be added, and new codes or
	  fields can be added to existing records.

	  The format incorporates a modular design.  Each file would
	  combine the records into an order that corresponds to the
	  type of data to be transmitted.  Meet entry records would have a
	  specific order.  Time standards would have another order.  When
	  specific record types are not needed, those records can be
	  omitted.   Certain fields were declared to be "mandatory" for
	  adequate identification of the data and to preserve unique
	  identifiers.

	  Format Design

	  SDI files have a SD3 extension. Example: meetrslt.sd3.

	  The basic design of the USS Interchange Format is a fixed record
	  length for all records.  Data is grouped together by type of
	  information, and records are linked to each other by common
	  fields or by record order.  The records comprise a single type
	  of information, e.g., one record for meet host data.  The file
	  structure has an implied order of less frequent data preceding
	  more frequent data, i.e., one meet, multiple teams, multiple
	  athletes per team, etc.

	  Each record is one-hundred sixty-two (162) bytes in length, 
	  with the last two bytes a carriage return and line feed.
	  Byte 161 is an ASCII 13 and byte 162 is an ASCII 10.  Each 
	  record has a two byte record identifier.  

	  Coding conventions

	  The first byte of the first record MUST be the first byte of
	  the file, and MUST begin an A0 record.

	  Fields which are not used should be blank filled.

	  "No blanks" means that there may not be ANY blanks ANYWHERE
	  in the field;  "non-blank" means that there MAY be blanks in
	  the field, but there MUST be AT LEAST ONE non-blank character
	  as well.

	  There are two levels of mandatory fields. M1 - must be 
	  included for the record to be useful. M2 - an exceptions 
	  report must be generated for records containing blank M2 fields.
	  M2 fields are necessary for the records to be processed by 
	  USS. M1 fields require a non-blank entry.  
   
	  All undefined space is named "future use" and MUST be blank
	  until defined explicitly.

	  The first two bytes of a record are always CONST, and are
	  case sensitive.

	  All ALPHA fields are left justified* and can contain any
	  letters, numbers and printable symbols.  Users may elect to have
	  alphabetic data in upper and lower case or upper case only. *Alpha 
	  fields containing only numeric data should be right justified.

	  All INT data are stored as ASCII digits and should be right 
	  justified and blank filled.  

	  All LOGICAL fields must contain a upper case 'T' an upper case
	  'F' or a blank.

	  !!! SDIF VERSION 3 DOCUMENT !!!

	  DEC numeric values are also ASCII digits and are right 
	  justified and blank filled.  An optional decimal may be used if 
	  fractional values occur.

	  PHONE fields can be formatted in any manner that maintains 
	  the integrity of the number.

	  All DATE fields have the format MMDDYYYY where MM is the month, 
	  DD is the day, and YYYY is the year.  If a date is supplied,
	  it must not have ANY blanks -- zero-fill each portion of the date.

	  CODE fields must match EXACTLY when "table checked", and ARE 
	  case sensitive.  The user should request new codes if required. 
	  The term "table checked" refers to the tables in the back of the
	  SDIF document, not a file supplied by U.S. Swimming.

	  USPS designates U.S. Postal Service state abbreviations and
	  should be capitalized.  

	  POSTAL CODES may be left or right justified, but should include
	  leading zeroes where defined (for example: a Vermont ZIP code
	  of 05452).

	  All TIME fields MUST match one of the following formats:
	  1) All blanks.
	  2) Have the format mm:ss.ss where mm is the minutes value and 
	     ss.ss is the seconds value to hundredths.  The third byte must
	     be a colon or a blank, and the sixth byte must be a period.
	     If a blank appears anywhere in this format, everything to the
	     left must also be blank.
	  3) TIME Code 020, left-justified and blank-filled.

	  !!! SDIF VERSION 3 DOCUMENT !!!

	  The USSNUM format consists of: date of birth + first 3 letters
	  of legal first name + middle initial + first 4 letters of last 
	  name. In the event that there is no middle initial or not enough
	  letters in the first or last name to fill the field, an asterisk
	  will be used. Special characters are removed. 
	  Examples: Catherine A. Durance = 011553CATADURA
		    Cy V. Young          = 091879CY*VYOUN
		    Thomas Chu           = 020981THO*CHU*
		    Ty Lee               = 011873TY**LEE*
		    Dave T. O'Neil       = 030367DAVTONEI

	  
	  If a time field is used, then the COURSE/STATUS code field 
	  immediately following (if present) must be entered also.  When
	  meets are timed finals only, the swim time should be entered in
	  the Finals Time field.

	  A NAME type must be in the following format:  last name followed
	  by a comma and a space, followed by first name and an optional
	  space and middle initial. Example:  O'Neil, John Q

	  Coding Examples


	  The user of this interchange format has few limitations on the
	  required records and the logical order.  There are only two
	  required records - the file description record "A0" and the
	  file terminator record "Z0".  These two records bracket a data
	  transmission batch in a logical structure.  Optional records have
	  mandatory fields to provide essential information to understand
	  and utilize the data supplied.  Meet management applications will
	  dominate the types of data transmissions.  The format has been
	  designed to accommodate other USS uses.

	  Meet Entry

	  Example - two teams in a dual meet.  One team is the host and
	  merges host team data with visiting team data.  The visiting team
	  provides an "A0" record, a "B1" record as a courtesy, a "B2"
	  record as a courtesy, a "C1" record, a "C2" record, seventy-four
	  "D0" and "D3" records for forty-eight swimmers, five "E0" records 
	  for the five relay entries, twenty-nine "F0" and "D0" records for 
	  relay swimmers and alternates, and a "Z0" record to close the file.

	  The host team merges a "C1" record, a "C2" record, sixty-three
	  "D0" and "D3" records for fifty one swimmers, six "E0" records 
	  for six relay entries, thirty-five "F0" records for the relay 
	  swimmers and alternates, and a "Z0" record is shared from the 
	  visiting team submission.  The diagram of the records is given 
	  below.

	       Visiting Team                 Host Team
	       "A0"   1 record               (shares same record)
	       "B1" 1 dual meet              (shares same record)
	       "B2" 1 names host team        (shares same record)

	       "C1" 1 visiting team          "C1" 1 host team
	       "C2" 1 visiting team          "C2" 1 host team

	       "E0" 5 relay entries          "E0" 6 relay entries

	       "F0" 29 relay swimmers        "F0" 35 relay swimmers

	     "Z0" 1 record                  (shares same record)

	  Swimmers who have not completed the 120-day waiting period are
	  coded with UNATTACHED status on the individual record, but they
	  may still be associated with the team.  The individual event
	  records may be in any order for that team.  The relay event
	  records may be in any order but the relay name records must
	  follow each relay event entry.

	  For meets with multiple teams the file would have the records
	  for one team together as a group, then the second team and so on
	  until all the teams are completed.  Unattached swimmers who are
	  not associated with a team would be grouped as an "unattached
	  team" with a team ID record that indicates that the athletes are
	  unattached.

	  It is the responsibility of the participating teams to provide
	  complete and accurate data.  The minimum required fields are
	  noted with an "M" in the mandatory column in the Format Design
	  section of this manual.  The host may require more information
	  to conduct the meet and teams should review the meet invitations
	  closely.
